3.iOS Tinder Clone app – Developing an application which mimics the Dating application 
Features : Login ,Sign up and Facebook Login ,Swipe Right and Swipe left, Contact Users 

4.Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)  
Application : Engineered an Intrusion detection system(which is to be implemented on a network) which checks for malicious data and drops that data packet using packet filtering mechanism
Built with: Xilinx ISE - Schematics, IP cores and VHDL programming language. 

5.Network Processor with Custom MIPS-like ISA integrated with FIFO, on NetFPGA Application: Designed a Custom 5 Stage Processor using Schematics, IP cores and Verilog in Xilinx ISE. Processor's architecture supported 32-bit instruction and 64-bit data width architecture. Tool : Xilinx ISE 10.1 Platform : NetFPGA 1G
- Designed and integrated a convertible FIFO that allows data to flow through NetFPGA router and the network processor - Integrated design on a NetFPGA and evaluated at a working frequency of 125 MHz.- Programmed a translator for Custom ISA assembly code to Binary in C
- Tested processor by running various programs including Bubble sort, Swap of two numbers 
 
6. Content based Routing with Hardware accelerated crypto engine & authentication on a multithreaded network processor:
The Content-Based Router (CBR) reads the content of a message and routes it to a specific recipient based on its content which is different from the usual IP based routing. Integrated the CBR with the Network Intrusion Detection System along with a crypto engine (encrypts data)
